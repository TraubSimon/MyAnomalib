"""Helper utilities for data

This moudle provides various utility functions for data handling.

The utilities are organized into several categories:

    - Image Handling: Functions for reading, writing and pre-processing image
    - Path Handling: Functions for validating and resolving file paths
    - Dataset splitting: Functions for splitting datasets into train/test/val
    - Download utilities: Functions for downloiading and extracting datasets

Example: 
    >>> from src.data.utils impoer read_img
    >>> image = read_image("path/to/image.jpg")
